Twitter parse challenge

To get started, run:

    % pip install -r requirements.txt


Submissions for a challenge are reviewed with the following criteria in mind:

  * All tests pass.
  * There is mimimal duplication of code.
  * The code is cleanly formatted and easy to read and follow.


Please do not leave dead code (code that has been commented out).  Submissions do not
need to follow PEP 8, but use four spaces instead of tabs.  Leave comments only
where something you're doing would otherwise have been unclear and hard to follow.
